Beginning of the WTW project

Rather than making sure that we use all Github /Gitpod features (Actions Projects, Wiki, etc)
let's just define minimum structure to start. I propose to use [Issues](https://github.com/pacific-north/initialize/issues) 
collections fo define the initial tasks starting with [History]().
